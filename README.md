# Non existing company portfolio

WebStudio is a responsive website created using HTML, CSS (utilizing the SASS preprocessor), and JavaScript technologies. This project served as a learning exercise where I first practiced HTML and CSS. 

After a few months, I refreshed the styles, repository, and added a Contact page, making it quite an experience to update my old CSS. 😅


## Demo
